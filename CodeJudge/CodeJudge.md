## About

Codejudge is a code-simulation platform for engineers to showcase their skills and get noticed by top tech companies on the basis of capabilities and not credentials. It assesses every engineer's technical skills using projects modeled on real-world scenarios and by evaluating functional and code-quality parameters.  

While algorithms and data structures provide building blocks for code, yet there are higher concepts that a developer needs to know of to build applications. This involves design principles, architecture, code quality and maintainability which is hard to judge through the current platforms. The proprietary skills data created based on the assessment from Codejudge lets companies hire smarter, faster, and without bias. 

Currently, Codejudge's assessment technology is used by reputed startups like Cardekho, Cred and Udaan among other top tech teams at middle and early-stage startups as well as global players like Crossover and Skuad.

## Hiring Process
