## About

Calendar is one of many innovative ideas from the team of John Hall. In fact, the company founders have created many other business applications. These include time tracking, project management, invoicing and billing, and payments solutions. These small business tools integrate with the Calendar app for even greater productivity. John Hall's ideology regarding resume and jobs is - "Would I have hired those people if I’d looked over their resumes in advance? Probably. But I didn’t need to, and frankly, I didn’t want to. I have better things to do with my time, and if you’re an entrepreneur, so do you."
