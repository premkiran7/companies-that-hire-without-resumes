## Typical Hiring Process

A typical hiring process for engineers normally involves resume screening, assignments, technical interviews, HR interviews and much more. Curating resumes that cater to a specific job description although essential is one of the most strenuous tasks involved in any hiring process. That's why I am relieved when I find companies that don't ask their candidates to produce resumes. I guess you too feel the same.
